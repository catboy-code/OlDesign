      </h1>
      
      <p>
        OlDesign is a small CSS library (&lt;1 kB gzipped and minified) that aims to work well on browsers like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netsurf-browser.org/">NetSurf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/tree/master/Userland/Applications/Browser" target="_blank">the SerenityOS Browser</a>, while still supporting some bells and whistles when viewed on modern browsers.

      <h2>
        Why does this exist?
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        This exists primarily because a lot of classless css libraries (like <a href="https://picocss.com/" target="_blank">picocss</a> and <a href="https://holidaycss.js.org/" target="_blank">holidaycss</a>) don't work on browsers like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netsurf-browser.org/">NetSurf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/tree/master/Userland/Applications/Browser" target="_blank">the SerenityOS Browser</a>, which I personally consider to be a shame because the primary user for such libraries is the kind of person who wants to create a simple website without much hassle; having it only support the latest and greatest browsers doesn't sit right with me personally.<br><br>hence, this is a thing now!
      </p>

        Features
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>It supports small browsers like NetSurf (even Internet Explorer 11 if you use it for some reason, although you should probably switch to a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">much better browser</a>).
          <li>It's Responsive and works well with smartphone screens and old CRTs alike. 
          <li>It's (almost) classless, so you don't need to bother about classes and ids; you can just chuck in your html file and it'll work out of the box.
          <li>It's tiny (&lt;1 kB gzipped and minified), so you don't have to worry about someone with a slow connection having a problem with your website.
