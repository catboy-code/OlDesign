# OlDesign.

> a minimal CSS Library that works well on smaller browsers.

## Browser support

this can be broken into three categories: 

1. Works flawlessly: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other browsers built on their engines (Blink, Gecko/Goanna, WebKit)

2. kinda works (incomplete support): NetSurf/visurf works fairly well but I count it here because `a:hover` doesn't seem to work; the SerenityOS browser renders some stuff properly, but headings are super small and everything in the `nav` element is unclickable.

3. borked (no support intended): dillo and Hv3 are unable to render anything properly, and haven't been maintained for many years; hence, they won't be supported.

## Usage

Just add this to your html file: 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catboy-code/OlDesign/main/design.min.css">
```

or simply download `design.min.css` to use manually in your project.

## This project feels pretty jank

Unfortunately, it is. I consider the project to be very incomplete at this point; that said, any contributions are welcome!
